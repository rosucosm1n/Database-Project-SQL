# SQL-Database-Project

This is a project in which me and a classmate had to create a database for a supermarket.
My tasks in this project were:
- Creation of the database, with all it's particularities
- Interaction between the database and the UI (created using Java)
- Creation of the documentation

My classmate created the UI and contributed at the interaction of the UI with the database.
