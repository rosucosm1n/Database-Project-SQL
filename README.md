# SQL-Database-Project

This is a project in which me and a classmate had to create a database for a supermarket.
My tasks in this project were:
- Creation of the database, with all its particularities
- Interaction between the database and the UI (created using Java)
- Creation of the documentation

My classmate created the UI and contributed at the interaction of the UI with the database.

This is the main menu where u have to select if your role either client or administrator.

This is the client menu with the type of products that the supermarket has in stock and the price of each of them.

This is the administrator menu where you can add new products, or see sales, or see how many products are left in stock.
